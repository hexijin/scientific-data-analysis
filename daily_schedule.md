### Part 1: Scientific Python (using Imad Pasha, *Astronomical Python*)

#### Week 1 &mdash; Shell and Python Quick-Start/Review

* May 16 &mdash; Complete Chapters 1 to 3: Unix (shell) Basics, Installing Python, and the Astronomy/Scientific Data Analysis Stack &mdash; Problem Set 0: Get Anaconda downloaded and installed and use the IPython interface &mdash; Discussed Python language features, syntax, and style (PEP 8), differences between Windows and Unix shells, globbing, and Python's OSIL functionality
* May 17 &mdash; Complete Chapter 4: Introduction to Python &mdash; Problem Set 1: Use for loops to compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (screenshot your solution in IPython) &mdash; Discussed notebook tools and IDEs

#### Week 2 Matplotlib and Numpy

* May 21 &mdash; Complete Chapter 5: Visualization with Matplotlib ([&sect;2 A Simple Plot](./aspy/c05/c05s02.ipynb), [&sect;4 Subplots](./aspy/c05/c05s04.ipynb), [&sect;5 Adjusting Marker Properties](./aspy/c05/c05s05.ipynb), [&sect;6 Adjusting Ticks](./aspy/c05/c05s06.ipynb), [&sect;7 Adjusting Fonts and Font Sizes](./aspy/c05/c05s07.ipynb), [&sect;8 Multiple Subplots](./aspy/c05/c05s08.ipynb), [&sect;9 Subplot Mosaic](./aspy/c05/c05s09.ipynb), [&sect;10 Research Example: Displaying a Best Fit](./aspy/c05/c05s10.ipynb), [&sect;11 Error Bars](./aspy/c05/c05s11.ipynb), [&sect;12 Plotting *n*-Dimensional Data](./aspy/c05/c05s12.ipynb), [&sect;13 Color Bars](./aspy/c05/c05s13.ipynb)) &mdash; Install (if not already part of your Python distribution) and start working in Jupyter Lab &mdash; Problem Set 2: Make some histogram and scatter plots using the [iris dataset](./iris/iris_dataset.csv) (save your plots as a Jupyter Lab notebook) ([PS02](./psets/ps02.ipynb))
* May 25 &mdash; Complete Chapter 6: Numerical Computing with NumPy ([&sect;5 Research Example: An Exoplanet Transit](./aspy/c06/c06s05.ipynb)) &mdash; Create a github account, fork the repo: brianhill/scientific-data-analysis &mdash; Then figure out how to get a local copy onto your machine of your forks (hexijin/scientific-data-analysis or jeremychoy/scienctific-data-analsysis) and this will involve installing git on your machine (which will be different for Mac or Windows) &mdash; Started learning shell access to git, and the add, commit, push cycle (which we will be adding more to once that is routine)

#### Week 3 &mdash; SciPy and AstroPy

* May 28 &mdash; Complete Chapter 7: Scientific Computing with SciPy ([&sect;2 Numerical Integration](./aspy/c07/c07s02.ipynb)) &mdash; Problem Set 3 (in addition to working through all the code in the chapter): Do Exercise 7.1, and show Jeremy how to save his first version of `scientific-data-analysis/jeremy/aspy07/c07.ipynb` (which will require some `mkdir` and `cd` commands in his local git repository), and then how to use `git` to add the new notebook, commit it, and push it (and you should both repeat the add-commit-push cycle while building out your notebooks until executing those commands in the shell is completely routine)

#### === BELOW THIS DIVISION IS GOAL/TENTATIVE PLAN &mdash; NOT ACTUAL ===

* May 31 &mdash; Complete Chapter 8: Astropy and Astronomical Packages

### Part 2: Data Science Foundations (using Joel Grus, *Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition*)

#### Week 4

* June 4 &mdash; Chapters 1 and 2: Introduction and A Crash Course in Python 
* June 4 &mdash; ALTERNATIVELY, WE COULD DO CHAPTER 9 OF PASHA FOR JUNE 4 SINCE CHAPTERS 1-3 OF GRUS ARE PROBABLY REALLY RAPID TO REVIEW FOR BOTH OF YOU NOW
* June 7 &mdash; Chapters 3 and 4: Visualizing Data (this is Matplotlib again) and Linear Algebra (Grus introduces his Vector and Matrix classes)

#### Week 5

* June 11 &mdash; Chapters 5 and 6: Statistics and Probability
* June 14 &mdash; Chapters 7 and 8: Hypotheses &amp; Inference and Gradient Descent

#### Week 6

* June 18 &mdash; Chapters 9 and 10: Getting Data and Working with Data
* June 21 &mdash; Chapters 11 and 13: Machine Learning and Naive Bayes

#### Week 7

* June 25 &mdash; Chapters 18 and 19: Neural Networks and Deep Learning &mdash; A great stretch goal for the Data Science Portion of the IS would be to follow along with this live coding session (and build the code with him, pausing when you need to catch up): [Joel Grus - Building a Deep Learning Library](https://joelgrus.com/2017/12/04/livecoding-madness-building-a-deep-learning-library/)
