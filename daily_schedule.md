## Daily Schedule (Actual &mdash; Kept Retrospectively)

*Regular meeting schedule is Wednesdays and Saturdays, 11:00-12:00*

### Part 1: Scientific Python (using *Astronomical Python*)

#### Week 1 &mdash; Shell and Python Quick-Start/Review

* May 16 &mdash; Self-study Chapter 1 to 3 and review with Brian
* May 17 &mdash; Complete Chapter 4: Introduction to Python &mdash; Problem Set 1: Use for loops to compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers

#### Week 2 Matplotlib and Numpy

* May 21 &mdash; Install (if not already part of your Python distribution) and start working in Jupyter Lab &mdash; Complete Chapter 5: Visualization with Matplotlib ([&sect;2 A Simple Plot](./aspy/c05/c05s02.ipynb), [&sect;4 Subplots](./aspy/c05/c05s04.ipynb), [&sect;5 Adjusting Marker Properties](./aspy/c05/c05s05.ipynb), [&sect;6 Adjusting Ticks](./aspy/c05/c05s06.ipynb), [&sect;7 Adjusting Fonts and Font Sizes](./aspy/c05/c05s07.ipynb), [&sect;8 Multiple Subplots](./aspy/c05/c05s08.ipynb), [&sect;9 Subplot Mosaic](./aspy/c05/c05s09.ipynb), [&sect;10 Research Example: Displaying a Best Fit](./aspy/c05/c05s10.ipynb), [&sect;11 Error Bars](./aspy/c05/c05s11.ipynb), [&sect;12 Plotting *n*-Dimensional Data](./aspy/c05/c05s12.ipynb), [&sect;13 Color Bars](./aspy/c05/c05s13.ipynb)) &mdash; Problem Set 2: Make some histogram and scatter plots using the [iris dataset](./iris/iris_dataset.csv) (save your plots as a Jupyter Lab notebook) ([PS02](./psets/ps02.ipynb))
* May 25 &mdash; Complete Chapter 6: Numerical Computing with NumPy ([&sect;5 Research Example: An Exoplanet Transit](./aspy/c06/c06s05.ipynb)) &mdash; Create a github account, fork the repo: brianhill/scientific-data-analysis &mdash; Then figure out how to get a local copy onto your machine of your forks (hexijin/scientific-data-analysis or jeremychoy/scienctific-data-analsysis) and this will involve installing git on your machine (which will be different for Mac or Windows) &mdash; At some point, we need to learn the shell access to git

#### Week 3 &mdash; SciPy and AstroPy

### BELOW THIS DIVISION IS PLAN NOT ACTUAL

* May 28 &mdash; Ch. 7: Scientific Computing with SciPy
* May 31 &mdash; Ch. 8: Astropy and Astronomical Packages

### Part 2: Data Science Foundations (using *Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition*)

#### Week 4

* June 4 &mdash; Ch. 1–2: What is Data Science? Python Review
* June 7 &mdash; Ch. 3: Visualizing Data

#### Week 5

* June 11 and 14 &mdash; Ch. 4–6: Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability

#### Week 6

* June 18 and 21 &mdash; Ch. 7–8: Hypothesis Testing, Gradient Descent

#### Week 7

* June 25 &mdash; Ch. 9–10: Getting Data, Working with Data
* Possible bonus topic for Saturday after term end &mdash; Ch. 11–12: Machine Learning intro
* I will add that another stretch goal for Part II is that it would be great to spend an hour or two following along with this: [Joel Grus - Building a Deep Learning Library](https://joelgrus.com/2017/12/04/livecoding-madness-building-a-deep-learning-library/)
