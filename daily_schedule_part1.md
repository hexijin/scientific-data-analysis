### Part 1: Scientific Python (using Imad Pasha, *Astronomical Python*)

Part 1 Uses Pasha and lasts for the first three weeks of Term 6

#### Week 1 &mdash; Shell and Python Quick-Start/Review

* May 16 &mdash; Complete Chapters 1 to 3: Unix (shell) Basics, Installing Python, and the Astronomy/Scientific Data Analysis Stack &mdash; Problem Set 0: Get Anaconda downloaded and installed and use the IPython interface &mdash; Discussed Python language features, syntax, and style (PEP 8), differences between Windows and Unix shells, globbing, and Python's Operating System Insulation Layer (OSIL)
* May 17 &mdash; Complete Chapter 4: Introduction to Python &mdash; Problem Set 1: Use for loops to compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (screenshot your solution in IPython) &mdash; Discussed notebook tools and IDEs

#### Week 2 Matplotlib and Numpy

* May 21 &mdash; Complete Chapter 5: Visualization with Matplotlib &mdash; Install (if not already part of your Python distribution) and start working in Jupyter Lab &mdash; Problem Set 2: Make some histogram and scatter plots using the [iris dataset](./iris/iris_dataset.csv) (save your plots as a Jupyter Lab notebook)
* May 25 &mdash; Complete Chapter 6: Numerical Computing with NumPy &mdash; Create a github account, fork the repo: brianhill/scientific-data-analysis &mdash; Then figure out how to get a local copy onto your machine of your fork (`hexijin/scientific-data-analysis`) and this will involve installing git on your machine (which will be different for Mac or Windows) &mdash; Started learning shell access to git, and the add, commit, push cycle (which we will be adding more to once that is routine)

#### Week 3 &mdash; SciPy and AstroPy

* May 28 &mdash; Complete Chapter 7: Scientific Computing with SciPy &mdash; Problem Set 3 (in addition to working through all the code in the chapter): Do Exercise 7.1 &mdash; Introduced the linear algebra concepts and notation for column vectors, row vectors, and matrix and vector multiplication
* June 1 &mdash; Complete Chapter 8: Astropy and Astronomical Packages &mdash; As Problem Set 4 (in addition to working through all the code in the chapter): Do the Chapter 8 exercises &mdash; Finally, it's time to add to your git knowledge the ideas of origin and upstream, and a second cyle of operations: how to fetch from upstream (my GitHub repo), rebase (in your local repo), and push your rebased changes to your origin (your GitHub fork of my repo)
