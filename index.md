# Scientific Data Analysis, Data Science, and Machine Learning in Python

*An independent study with two parts:*

*Part 1: Consolidate and advance understanding of mainstream and cutting edge scientific data analysis techniques using Chapters 1-8 of Pasha,* Astronomical Python

*Part 2: Survey data science techniques up to and including neural net and deep learning implementations (which are the relevant preparation for a subsequent study of natural-language processing and LLMs) using Chapters 1-11, 13, 18, 19 and 21 of Grus,* Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Ed.

Term 6 of Academic Year 2024-2025, Deep Springs College

Mentor: [Prof. Brian Hill](../index.html)

Student: Hexi Jin (DS 23)

## Independent Study Application and Preliminary Syllabus

* PDF of [Independent Study Application](./IndependentStudyApplication.pdf)
* PDF of [Preliminary Syllabus](./PreliminarySyllabus.pdf)

## Materials

### Required

* Imad Pasha, *Astronomical Python*
    * Pasha's examples use data hosted at [https://zenodo.org/records/10732223](https://zenodo.org/records/10732223)
* Joel Grus, *Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition*
    * We may need to copy over resources from Grus's GitHub repo for the book [https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch)

### Optional

* Both Pasha and Grus include adequate introductions to Python features as they use them, but you may want a more systematic introduction to use as a reference. An excellent one is David Beazley, *Python Distilled.* It is actually a distillation and update of his time-tested *Python: Essential Reference,* which was becoming overly-long as the Python language feature set kept growing.
