### Part 2: Data Science Foundations (using Joel Grus, *Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition*)

Part 2 Uses Grus and lasts for the remaining three-and-a-half weeks of Term 6

#### === BELOW THIS DIVISION IS GOAL/TENTATIVE PLAN &mdash; NOT ACTUAL ===

#### Week 4 &mdash; Yet Another Review of Python &mdash; Some Vector and Matrix Algebra &mdash; Statistics and Probability

* June 4 &mdash; Chapters 1-3: Another excellent review of Python and Matplotlib which will help systematize your understanding of the language features you were using in Pasha's book &mdash; Chapter 4: Linear Algebra, wherein Grus introduces his Matrix and Vector classes ([Ch. 4 Matrix Algebra](./grus/grus04.ipynb))
* June 7 &mdash; Chapters 5 and 6: Statistics and Probability

#### Week 5 &mdash; Optimization (aka Minimization and Maximization) &mdash; Working with Data

* June 11 &mdash; Chapters 7 and 8: Hypotheses &amp; Inference and Gradient Descent
* June 14 &mdash; Chapters 9 and 10: Getting and Working with Data

#### Week 6 &mdash; Machine Learning &mdash; Neural Networks &mdash; Start Deep Learning

* June 18 &mdash; Chapters 11 and 13: Machine Learning and Naive Bayes
* June 21 &mdash; Chapters 18 and 19: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

#### Week 7 &mdash; Continue Deep Learning &mdash; Introduction to Natural Language Processing

* June 25 &mdash; A great finale for Part 2 of the IS would be to (1) Do this real-time coding session to see how a real pro codes, including type-hinting, adherence to systematic style choices, and code testing (you build the code with Grus, pausing the video whenever you need to catch up, because he is fast): [Joel Grus - Building a Deep Learning Library](https://joelgrus.com/2017/12/04/livecoding-madness-building-a-deep-learning-library/) and (2) Do Chapter 21, Natural Language Processing (which does not include the 2017 &ldquo;Attention is All You Need&rdquo; transformers revolution, but which sets you up for a second-semester course in machine-learning that almost any computer science department will offer, and which will cover LLMs)
